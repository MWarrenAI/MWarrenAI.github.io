                <p class="about__description">
                    The core challenge was implementing a <strong>Global State-Switching Mechanic</strong> within 24-hours. 
                    The team engineered an event-driven system where the light switch (bioluminescence) state changes across all environmental 
                    "Light Listeners," allowing for complex puzzle logic. This would then allow the character to navigate around obstacles e.g. walls
					and other environmental changes effected by the light surrounding the character. The sanity mechanic would also trigger other objects which
					may effect the environment around the character such as friendly npcs suddenly becomming agressive. Light is therefore a mechanic that both
					influences the state of the environment and creates challenges for the player.
