                <p class="about__description">
                    The core challenge was implementing a <strong>Global State-Switching Mechanic</strong> within 24-hours. 
                    The team engineered an event-driven system where the light switch (bioluminescence) state changes across the environment. 
                    <strong>Sanity Mechanic:</strong> As the player loses sanity, environmental objects shift—friendly NPCs can become aggressive 
					and controls become more challenging to simulate deep-sea swimming in a panic induced state simular to "the bends" you would get
					from scuba diving.

					The original plan was to have the player navigate three stages each with their own puzzle and would get darker the further into the cave the player got.
					A dialog system is still in the process of being implemented as part of a future update planned to be released. This would involve moral choices that could
					further influence the environment: you may wish to for example trick an npc to give you an item or choose to be honest and therefore carry out a favour for the npc.
					Choices could therefore disrupt the ecosystem or block passages otherwise accessible - this would give the player the feeling that their choices matter during the Game
					but not in such a way that their choice would stop progress rather this may merely inconvenience/help them. This dialog system would explore the interactions the player 
					could have and further improve the playability of the game.

                        After being exiled by the Queen, a lost knight finds themselves on a quest to retrieve the artifact that
						caused this spiral to begin with. Using bioluminescence, switch between the light and the dark to solve puzzles, 
						interact with NPCS, and reach the deepest trenches of the ocean.

                        Within this game, we play as a character named Firefly (Ef), who is based on a Firefly Squid. Every character is based on
						different sea creatures, mixing humanoid elements with those of said creatures.

						Various aquatic life animals and plants were considered as part of this world's environment - some ideas just so happened to coincide with what aspects which can be
						seen in nature. The ideas brainstormed by the group were aspects we'd expect to see underwater: corals were our main influence as well as underwater cave systems, from
						what the group could observe the deeper into caves you go you generally see things such as dead animals or dark enclosed spaces. The final area of the game would therefore
						involve a dark cave system with stalactites that may contain gemstones so as not to look too dull for the player. The final room would be a boss area where the player comes
						face to face with the queen.

                <span class="skills-list__item">What Worked: Rapid Event-Driven Prototyping</span>
				<p> The Project itself was considered a success in that, we had a working game within the time allocated, the concept was interesting and showed a lot of future potential if more time was
				spent on the development of the game itself. Sadly due to the lack of time allocated by the GameJam the group had to submit what they had even though we all seemed very keen to continue development
				at that time. The group dynamic worked well despite setbacks because everyone had a set task and we would all communicate with one another to figure out what ideas worked and which ideas should be
				considered in future development for the game.
                <span class="skills-list__item">Challenge: Naming Convention Conflicts</span>
				<p> One of the greatest obstacles the game had in development were the naming schemes the designers had chosen, this caused a setback that slowed the depository gathering down as team members were unfamiliar
				with the Github depository environment, after several reviews and some explanations later we all soon decided on a uniformed folder structure that made sense for the team at the time. If given more time we
				would have all agreed to making an asset folder that made more logical sense at the time. Unfortunately due to time constraints the folder structure was unorganised however, this did not effect the performance
				of the game but rather just made implementing game mechanics a little difficult.</p>
                <span class="skills-list__item">Future development: Dialogue System</span>
				<p> A dialogue system as discussed earlier would improve some mechanics to make the game more interactive, some elements Mark will be improving personally as small additions like various lighting conditions,
				such as rays of light or glowing monsters would add to the game's ambience. Further developments could also be considered such as the development of the boss level and small details like floating animations
				and water particle physics (e.g. rising bubbles). The concept for the UI interface is below that has yet to be added to the game.
